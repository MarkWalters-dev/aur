# v0.9.0

Please report all bugs in our [Discord server](https://slimevr.dev/discord) for now in the appropriate development channels (`#server`, `#gui`, `#autobone`, etc.). If you need tech support or are not sure if you did find a bug, please use the `#support-forum`.
Please note that this version will migrate your config from the install folder to `%AppData%\dev.slimevr.SlimeVR` (on Windows).

## Use the installer to install or update!
Use the installer to install or update SlimeVR if you're on Windows. You can find it here:
* Windows web installer: https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Installer/releases/latest/download/slimevr_web_installer.exe
* To run SlimeVR, use the shortcut from the start menu or desktop, or open the installation folder and launch slimevr.exe.

### ~~Flatpak distribution for Linux~~
Flatpak is not being updated because our framework is using a old version of `webkit2gtk` at the moment, we will update it when our framework releases a more stable release that supports the new version of it.
