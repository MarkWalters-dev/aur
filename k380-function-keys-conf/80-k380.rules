# Note that there is an issue in BlueZ which makes this rule apply only
# for the initial connection. When disconnected and reconnected later,
# the "add" action is never produced:
#
#   https://github.com/bluez/bluez/issues/933
#
# This means that power-cycling the keyboard after the initial connection
# will lose the Fn key setting and it will NOT be re-applied on reconnection.
