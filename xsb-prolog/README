This package creates a symlink /opt/xsb-5.0.0 *during compilation* on you real
system! Then it tries to remove when package is ready.

The only verified way to build and install the package is:

    makepkg -srCc
    pacman -U ./xsb-prolog-5.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz

Option -i isn't supported, because I have to guarantee removal of /opt/xsb-5.0.0
symlink. It is done using shell trap.
