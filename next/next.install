    neXt is built with the Unity3D game engine. As from neXt version 1.473
    and higher, neXt is built against Unity3D 5.6. From that version on,
    only SDL2 input controllers are supported.
    More information can be found at:
    http://next-rc-heli-simulator.xobor.de/t527f15-The-latest-version-v-can-not-find-usb-controller.html

    Long story short, you need to setup your USB controller the right way:
    Use aur/controllermap or aur/antimicro to generate the SDL config string,
    save it into a simple text file at "~/neXt/controllerconfigs.txt"
    and it will get automatically loaded at the next startup.
