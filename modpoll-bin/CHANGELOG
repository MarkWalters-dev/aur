     * Add support to display integer values as unsigned values

  Version 3.14 (2024-09-07)

     * Read  device  identification  for  a  slave  conformity level of 1
       triggered wrongly an Invalid reply error

  Version 3.13 (2024-08-09)

     * Fixed bug regards display of 64-bit input registers

     * Added support for 64-bit data types for FC3, FC4 and FC16
     * Fixed issue of Read Device Identification (-t id) being limited to
       slaved address 1

  Version 3.11 (2024-01-22)

     * Added Read Device Identification for FC 43 subfunction 14 (-t id)
     * Added Read File Record FC 20 (-t file)
     * Added Write File Record FC 21 (-t file)
     * Added Lufkin ELAM protocol variant (-x)
     * Modbus UDP: Fix length detection when transaction ID is set to 0
     * Modbus/TCP: Fix wrong invalid MBAP ID/invalid frame indication for
       the  following  frame  if extranous characters are sent in the TCP
       stream
     * Added Linux ARMv6 RPI (32-bit) platform for Pi Zero

  Version 3.10 (2021-03-26)

     * Added Linux ARMv8 AArch64 (64-bit) platform

  Version 3.9 (2020-07-14)

     * Added support for single register and single coil writes
     * Display function code used in protocol configuration
     * Removed automatic fallback to FC6 added in 3.7.

  Version 3.8 (2020-03-24)

     * Writing negative values was causing Unrecognized option or missing
       option parameter error under Linux

  Version 3.7 (2019-07-21)

     * Write  functions  with  a count of 1 use now the following scheme:
       Registers  use FC16 first, and if an illegal function exception is
       received  will  try  FC6  as  fallback. Coils always use FC5 for a
       count  of  1. This helps with slave devices which do not implement
       mandatory FC16.
