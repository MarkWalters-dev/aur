This package is based on the debian package and uses their copy of the
upstream package that is no longer available and all the patches.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This package was debianized by David A. van Leeuwen <vleeuwen@debian.org> on
Thu, 23 Sep 1999 15:24:33 +0200.

It was originally downloaded from http://www.speech.kth.se/snack

Currently, a modification from
http://wize.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/wize/wize2/wize/snack2.2.10/
is used.

The files demos/tcl/tclkit-linux-x86, demos/tcl/sdx,
demos/tcl/right_back.shape and mac/snack.mcp.sit.hqx have been removed
from the upstream tarball because they lack source code.

The files generic/SnackMp3.c, generic/jkFormatMP3.c, generic/jkFormatMP3.h
have been removed from the upstream tarball because they are
not DFSG-free (have restrictions on commercial use).

Hello Tom,

You found the correct Roger Lindell. I am the original author of ffa.c but
it was a port of FORTRAN code from an old IEEE book on Digital Signal
Processing so I'm not quite sure if I'm the copyright holder or not. If
I am the copyright holder then you are free to use it under GPL.

Best regards,

Roger

Subject: Looking for the Roger Lindell who wrote "ffa.c"

Hello,

I apologize if I have contacted the wrong Roger Lindell, but I am
looking for the copyright holder (and author) of "ffa.c", a source file
included with the Snack audio utility for TCL.

If this is not you, sorry to have wasted your time! However, if it is
you, fantastic! We are trying to determine the license terms for this
piece of source code, and no license is indicated in the file.

We think it is very likely that this code is under the same license as
the rest of Snack, which is the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 or
later, but we are hoping you can confirm this.

Thanks in advance,

Tom Callaway
