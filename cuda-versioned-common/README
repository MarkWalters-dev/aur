*** Versioned CUDA Toolkits for Arch Linux ***

This file provides two functions.

Firstly, it provides a file conflict with any normal, non-versioned cuda packages.
This is neccessary as having a package conflict would prevent installing multiple
versioned cuda packages, as they all provide cuda. This would defeat the whole purpose.

Secondly, it provides a brief overview of how the versioned cuda system is configured:

Versioned cuda is a small project of mine to allow having multiple versions of the
CUDA Toolkit installed, while still using the Arch Linux package management system
(i.e. avoiding the runfile installers).

Each version of the CUDA Toolkit is installed in its own directory under /opt/cuda,
with a "default" symlink to the currently selected version. This symlink is managed
by the "archlinux-cuda" program, provided in 'cuda-versioned-common'.

This system is based on Arch Linux's method of managing Java environments.
"archlinux-cuda" is in fact a modified version of "archlinux-java".
