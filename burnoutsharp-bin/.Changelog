## 2023-10-26, burnoutsharp-bin 2.9.0-1

* Bump to 2.9.0
* Project rename to `BinaryObjectScanner` imminent, distribution archive name 
has already changed

 * Remove `mono` dependency
  * Remove convenience script that simplified `mono` execution
 * Add `casclib` and `stormlib` dependencies

None of these changes should be user-impacting.  Check the release notes, as 
there are some breaking changes in the release binary to be aware of.
